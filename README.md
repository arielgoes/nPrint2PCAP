# nPrint2PCAP

This tool aims to resolve a segmentation fault behavior generated by nPrint (present until version 1.2.1) when nPrint files are converted back to PCAP.

This error may (or may not) occur with different nprint files.

For instance, it does happens with [`port80.pcap`](https://github.com/arielgoes/nprint_to_pcap/tree/main/examples/port80.pcap) file if we try to rebuild it into a PCAP file, but it does not happen to [`port443.pcap`](https://github.com/arielgoes/nprint_to_pcap/blob/main/examples/port443.pcap).

We assume all nPrint files are being generated as follows:
```
nprint -F -1 -P <filename>.pcap -i -u -t -4 -6 -p 0 -O 4 -W <filename>.npt -S
```
